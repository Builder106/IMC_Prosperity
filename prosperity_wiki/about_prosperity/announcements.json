During this maintenance, we will update the leaderboard and Archipelago island with the new scores. You can continue making progress with Round 2 and find ideas to make more SeaShells trading the Picnic Baskets. \n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience. We are working to ensure the gameplay is a fair and a pleasant experience for everyone and we appreciate all your efforts so far!\n\nPlease keep a look out at the ⁠announcements channel for more information on the upcoming maintenance mode."
