The value of the Rainforest Resin has been stable throughout the history of the archipelago, the value of Kelp has been going up and down over time, and the value of Squid Ink can also swing a bit, but some say there is a pattern to be discovered in its prize progression. All algorithms uploaded in the tutorial round will be processed and generate results instantly, so you can experiment with different programs and strategies."

The first trade is a conversion of your SeaShells into a foreign currency, the last trade is a conversion from a foreign currency into SeaShells. Everything in between is up to you. Give some thought to what series of trades you would like to do, as there might be an opportunity to walk away with more shells than you arrived with."
