IMC Prosperity stands for fair play and values skillsets and knowledge to write algorithms which could perform well in simulated real market conditions and not algorithms which exploits unfair advantage based on past participation or data leak or any form of look-ahead bias.\n\nEffective start of round 3, any teams doing hardcoded submissions will be disqualified from Prosperity with immediate effect, including all players in those teams. When those players move to different teams, those teams will be disqualified as well. \n\nWe will be taking retrospective action on teams that hardcoded their submissions during Round 2 so that those teams do not have an unfair disadvantage. We will send out more information about this later today."
